<h2>Core Development Patterns</h2>
<p>
  The core development microservice development pattern addresses the basics of building a microservice.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Service granularity:Making a service
      too coarse-grained with responsibilities that overlap into different business 
      problems domains makes the service difficult to maintain and change over time. 
      Making the service too fine-grained increases the overall complexity of the 
      application and turns the service into a “dumb” data abstraction layer with no 
      logic except for that needed to access the data store.
  </li>
</ol>
